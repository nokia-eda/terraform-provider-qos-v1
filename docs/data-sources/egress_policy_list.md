A higher n gives more importance to the previous average, smoothing peaks and lows in the queue. Lower n makes the average closer to the current queue size. If this leaf is absent, the default value is used.

- `max_drop_probability_percent` (Number) If the queue depth is between min and max threshold then this the probability with which packets are dropped or marked.
- `max_threshold` (Number) The maximum threshold parameter for a RED-managed queue in bytes. When the average queue length exceeds the max value, all packets are dropped (or marked if ECN is enabled). Mutually exclusive with min-threshold-percent and max-threshold-percent.
